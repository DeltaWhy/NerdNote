# First note

This is your first note! Start editing and see the results.

* Bulleted lists are easy to make
* Just format them like this
    + You can even nest them if you want
    + Cool, huh?

You can also make _italic_ and **bold** text with just a few keystrokes.

    function embedCode()
    {
        line = "    " + line;  //That's four spaces!
    }

## Headers

The number of '#' symbols is the level of the header.

That's it! Happy editing!
